# Overview
This course is designed for individuals aiming to become Back-End Developers with international competency standards set by Google. By the end of the course, students will be able to independently create a simple RESTful API to support the functionality of an application.

# Course Content
1. Introduction to Back-End
Duration: 3 Hours 5 Minutes
Description: Explains the roles of front-end and back-end development, how clients and servers communicate via HTTP protocols, and the RESTful API architecture in building web services.
2. Basics of Node.js for Back-End
Duration: 8 Hours
Description: Introduces Node.js and covers the fundamentals such as global and process objects, modularization, Node Package Manager (NPM), event handling, filesystem operations, and streaming techniques.
3. Building Web Services Using Node.js
Duration: 9 Hours 43 Minutes
Description: Teaches how to build web services using native Node.js and the Hapi framework, as well as constructing simple RESTful APIs.
4. Deploying Web Services
Duration: 3 Hours 15 Minutes
Description: Covers the usage of Google Compute Engine, operating Compute Engine instances via SSH, and running RESTful APIs on Compute Engine instances.
5. Consuming and Testing RESTful APIs Using Postman
Duration: 4 Hours 40 Minutes
Description: Guides on installing Postman, consuming RESTful APIs for testing purposes, and writing automated test scenarios using Postman.
6. Learning Evaluation
